## Problem 1

::: {.uw-homework-problem}

This is a really hard problem. I probably won't get it right, but I will try my
hardest and show my work! When in doubt, make a fancy-looking document! 

:::


### Solution

#### Part (a)

To address this problem, I first refer to @eq-pos-squares which states that 
the square of any real number is non-negative.

$$x^2 \geq 0 \ \forall \ x \in \mathbb{R} $$ {#eq-pos-squares}


::: {.uw-homework-proof}

Any real number $x$ satisfies $x > 0$, $x = 0$, or $x < 0$. If $x = 0$,
then $x^2 = 0 \geq 0$. If $x > 0$ then as a positive time a positive is
positive we have $x^2 = x x > 0$. If $x < 0$ then $−x > 0$ and so by
what we have just done $x^2 = (−x)^2 > 0$. So in all cases $x^2 \geq 0$.

:::

#### Part (b)

Next, I need to write an integral:

$$ F(x) = \int_{x=-\infty}^\infty f(x) \ dx$$ {#eq-integral}

To solve @eq-integral, I used numerical methods implemented by the 
code below, as suggested by @hilbornwalters2013.

```default
function mandelbrot(a)
    z = 0
    for i=1:50
        z = z^2 + a
    end
    return z
end

for y=1.0:-0.05:-1.0
    for x=-2.0:0.0315:0.5
        abs(mandelbrot(complex(x, y))) < 2 ? print("*") : print(" ")
    end
    println()
end
```

## Problem 2

::: {.uw-homework-problem}

This is a really easy problem. 

:::

The solution to this easy problem is shown in @fig-plot.

\

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
if (!dir.exists("images")) dir.create("images")
example_plot <- ggplot(cars) +
    geom_point(aes(x = speed, y = dist))
ggsave("plot.svg", path = "images", device = "svg")
result <- rnorm(1)
```

![The relationship between x and y](images/plot.svg){#fig-plot}

\

The result from the analysis shown in @fig-plot is `r result`
