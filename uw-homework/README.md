# homework template

This is a quarto template to custom format homework assignments over the course
of my PhD. The template renders pdf documents using the new typesetting software
`typst`; I intend to use frequent homework assignments as an opportunity to 
learn `typst`. As a result of the learning process, as well as the relative 
immaturity of the software, I expect this template to change frequently over
time. 

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template cl-roberts/.templates/uw-template
```

This will install the homework template and create an example qmd file
to use as a starting place for assignments.
